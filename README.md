Phone Number Tracker (India)
This is a Python-based application designed to track basic details of an Indian phone number. It uses the phonenumbers library to extract information like the region, telecom operator, and associated time zones based on the number provided by the user.

Features
Validation: Ensures the phone number is in a valid format.
Region Identification: Provides the telecom circle or location of the number.
Carrier Lookup: Identifies the telecom operator of the phone number.
Time Zone Information: Lists the time zones associated with the number.
How It Works
Input: The user enters a phone number, including the country code (e.g., +91 for India).
Parsing: The app validates and parses the phone number to ensure it conforms to Indian telecom standards.
Details Extraction: Using the phonenumbers library, the app retrieves:
Region: Based on the number prefix.
Operator: The original telecom operator of the number.
Time Zones: The time zones where the number is registered.
Output: Displays the extracted details in a user-friendly format.
Limitations
No Real-Time Location: This application does not and cannot provide real-time location tracking due to privacy laws.
Ported Numbers: The app may not always reflect updated operator details if a number has been ported to another network.
